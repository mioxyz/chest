#TODO
1. `*.jpg`, `*.mp4`, `*.mp3` encryption. I Think the files need to be .tar.gz zipped for it to be encryptable
2. abstract the subroutines into functions, remove redundancies
3. add verb open which opens data in application which does not alter data. Application is selected automatically.
   Which program is selected can be determined by map *.jpg -> firefox, *.mp3 -> mpg123, *.txt -> nano, *.mp4 -> vlc, etc.
   or alternatively the system's file selector (though I do not like my system's file selector, it doesn't get along
   with the applications I use).
4. ~~finish commented TODOs in code~~
